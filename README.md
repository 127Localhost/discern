ML Service API
====================

Overview
---------------------
This is an API wrapper for a service to grade arbitrary free text responses.
This is licensed under the AGPL, please see LICENSE.txt for details.
The goal here is to provide a high-performance, scalable solution that can effectively help students learn.
Feedback is a major part of this process, the feedback system has been left very flexible on purpose (you will see this later on).

Note that you will need the machine-learning repository to use all of the functionality here.  This repo is currently internal to edX, but will
hopefully be open sourced shortly.  Until then, the API can be used, but the celery tasks will not work.

How to Contribute
-----------------------
Contributions are very welcome.  The easiest way is to fork this repo, and then make a pull request from your fork.

The current backlog is in the [issues section](http://github.com/edx/ml-service-api/issues?labels=&page=1&state=open).
Please feel free to open new issues or work on existing ones.
