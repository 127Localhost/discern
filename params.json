","body":"### Overview\r\nThe ML service API allows anyone to use machine-learning based automated classification. This automated classification can work on both free text (essays, content, etc), and on numeric values.\r\n\r\nThe software uses artificial intelligence to grade student essays and short written answers, freeing professors for other tasks. The instant-grading software will be a useful pedagogical tool, enabling students to take tests and write essays over and over and improve the quality of their answers. \r\n\r\nWith increasingly large class sizes, it is impossible for most teachers to give students meaningful feedback on writing assignments. This technology will offer distinct advantages over the traditional classroom system, where students often wait days or weeks for grades. \r\n\r\n### Getting started\r\n\r\nThis command is used to clone the code repo:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ git clone git://github.com/edx/ml-service-api.git\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter cloning the repo, please refer to the documentation below for full install directions.\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\nAll the docs can be found on the [Readthedocs](http://ml-api.readthedocs.org/) site.\r\n\r\n### IRC channel\r\nJoin the conversation in the ##edxml channel on irc.freenode.net.
